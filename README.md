ACCESS
======

This is a research tool developed as a collaboration between Dundee University, the University of Miami in Flordia, and IBM in New York.  It is a specialised tool, likely at this moment to be of interest only to accessibility researchers.  It has no setup or easy way to install.

INSTALLATION
============

The code is provided in three separate subsystems.  

The ACCESS engine itself is Java code and handles the implementation of the reinforcement engine and the plugins and corrections.  This is the repository you are currently viewing the readme for.

The second part of the tool is the Windows DLL file - this is a C/JNI combination that allows for the framework to bridge the gap between the sandboxed virtual machine and the underlying I/O streams.  This must be compiled and made available on your system, and the engine must be made to point to it in the Windows operating contexts.

The third part is the event listener, which is a small C program which hooks into the event streams of the underlying Windows system.  This handles the provision of socket based data regarding mouse and keyboard interaction.
